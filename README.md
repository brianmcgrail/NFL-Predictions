# NFL Predictions

This is a Python project where I'm building a machine learning model to predict NFL game totals (Over/Under/Push) using historical game data and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to analyze historical NFL matchup stats, point spreads, and totals to see if we can make accurate predictions on future games based on similar past matchups.

## 🛠️ Features

- Data preprocessing with pandas
- Feature scaling with scikit-learn
- K-Nearest Neighbors model for predicting outcomes
- Analysis of nearest historical game results

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib (optional for visualizations)
